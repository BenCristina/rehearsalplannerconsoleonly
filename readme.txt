Welcome to the console-only version of the RehearsalPlanner application!

The aim of this application is to easily create a weekly rehearsal schedule for multiple actors (or any other artists) according to their availability.
No more fiddling around with papers looking back and forth multiple pages, just enter the actor's availability and have the program do the rest for you.
I have added some color to the program to make reading the output easier on the eye.

This is a scaled-down version of the actual application that I am currently developing.
It will still be updated and optimised along the way, this is not the final version!

Enjoy and feel free to reach out should you have any questions.

All the best,

Benjamin Cristina
